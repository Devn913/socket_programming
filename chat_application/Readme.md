## Report:
The given code consists of two C files: client.c and server.c. These files implement a basic client-server model using sockets in C. The server listens for incoming client connections on a specified port, and the client establishes a connection to the server and sends messages to it.

The client.c file includes several standard C libraries for socket programming, such as stdio.h, stdlib.h, sys/types.h, sys/socket.h, and so on. The program first checks if the user has provided the port number as a command-line argument. If not, it prints a message asking for the port number and exits the program. Next, it creates a socket using the socket() system call and checks if it was created successfully. Then, it resolves the server's IP address using gethostbyname() and sets up the server address struct using the resolved IP and the port number. Finally, it connects to the server using the connect() system call and enters a loop that allows the user to send messages to the server. Inside the loop, the program reads the user's input from stdin, writes it to the server using write(), reads the server's response using read(), and prints the response to stdout. The loop continues until the user types "Bye" (case-sensitive) to terminate the connection, at which point the program closes the socket and exits.

The server.c file also includes the standard C libraries for socket programming. It checks if the user has provided the port number as a command-line argument and exits the program if not. Then, it creates a socket using the socket() system call, sets up the server address struct using the provided port number and INADDR_ANY (which indicates that the server should listen on all available network interfaces), binds the socket to the server address using bind(), and listens for incoming connections using listen(). The program enters a loop that accepts incoming connections using accept() and handles each connection separately. Inside the connection-handling loop, the program reads the client's message using read(), prints it to stdout, reads the server's response from stdin, writes it to the client using write(), and checks if the response contains the string "Bye" (case-sensitive) to terminate the connection.

The given code provides a simple example of a client-server model using sockets in C. However, there are several limitations and potential issues with the code that should be addressed in a real-world implementation. For example, the code does not handle errors gracefully and may crash or produce unexpected behaviour if something goes wrong. Additionally, the code provides no security measures or data validation, making it vulnerable to attacks such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, etc. Finally, the code assumes that the client and server are running on the same machine, which may not happen in a real-world scenario. To address these issues, a more robust and secure implementation should be developed, including error handling, data validation, authentication, encryption, and so on.
